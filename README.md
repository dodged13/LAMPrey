This is the new method for analysing qPCR and qLAMP data whereby the relative fluoresence is taken into account across time/cycle number such that there is no investigator bias in the analysis method for quantitative PCR. The calculation is the fluoresence at N+5 is divided by N to show the efficiency of the PCR reaction. This allows a bell-curve to be plotted, where the highest point on the curve is where the reaction is most active and therefore the new Ct value. Testing the LAMPrey protocol against conventional methods showed an R2 value of 0.99, but LAMPrey has the benefit of not requiring a background dye and also being able to be applied to both qPCR and qLAMP data with ease.
